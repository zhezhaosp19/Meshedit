The project I implemented aim to linear interpolate Bezier Curves and Bezier Surface by control points. Also, I learn how to flip and split edges in order to upsampling meshes and make the meshes smoother and render better with shadows. The project gives me a more deep understanding of the engineering logic behind graphis.
